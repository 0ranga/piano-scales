### Why is it represented around a circle?
The circle that you see is called the circle of fifths. It highlights the relation between scales by placing the closest scales next to each other.
*For example: 
The closest scales to C are F and G, there is only one note that changes from F to C, same when you go from C to G.*

### What are the blue scales and the red scales?
It was chosen to only show the major and the minor scales because those are the most common scales in western music, classical and jazz. (To be more precise, the minor scales are the natural ones on the postr.)
There are 12 major scales and 12 minor scales, the red ones are the major and the blue ones are the minor.

### What are the numbers on the keys?
The numbers are the fingerings for the piano. On the top you can see the right hand fingerings and on the bottom the left hand fingerings. It was chosen to put them in that specific order to be consistent with the grand staff that puts the right hand on top and the left hand at the bottom.
